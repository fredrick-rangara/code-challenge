Description

This project is a collection of simple JavaScript programs that address several challenges. It includes a demerit points calculator to check a car's speed against a limit and assign points accordingly. It also features a comprehensive net salary calculator that takes basic salary and benefits as input to compute an individual's gross salary, PAYE (tax), NHIF, NSSF deductions, and final net salary. The calculations are based on the latest tax and deduction rates. The project also includes a grade generator that converts marks into grades.
